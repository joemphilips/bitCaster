# Your First Trade

*This page is a work-in-progress.*

Once you have [set up your wallet](/user-guide/getting-started/wallet-setup/), you're ready to place your first prediction.

## Overview

1. **Browse markets** — find an event you want to predict.
2. **Choose an outcome** — for example, YES or NO.
3. **Set your price and quantity** — decide how many shares to buy and at what price.
4. **Submit your order** — the matching engine will try to fill it against other participants.
5. **Track your position** — monitor your open orders and settled positions in your portfolio.

Detailed step-by-step instructions are coming soon.
