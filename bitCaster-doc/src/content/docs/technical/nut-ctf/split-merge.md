# Split & Merge

CTF tokens support split and merge operations that allow users to divide positions into smaller units or combine them. These operations are essential for trading, partial redemption, and portfolio rebalancing.

For the full specification, see the [CTF Split & Merge spec on GitHub](https://github.com/joemphilips/bitCaster/blob/main/nuts/CTF-split-merge.md).
