# Core CTF Protocol

Conditional Timed Fungible (CTF) tokens are Cashu ecash proofs whose keysets are bound to a `condition_id` -- a 32-byte hex identifier derived by the mint from a DLC oracle announcement. This binding allows tokens to represent conditional claims that are redeemable only when a specific outcome is attested by the oracle.

For the full specification, see the [CTF spec on GitHub](https://github.com/joemphilips/bitCaster/blob/main/nuts/CTF.md).
