# Nostr Kind 88 Events

DLC oracle announcements are published on Nostr as kind 88 events. These events contain the oracle's public key, the event descriptor (outcome definitions), and the nonce points needed for attestation. Cashu mints use these announcements to derive `condition_id` values and create CTF keysets.
